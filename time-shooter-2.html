<hr>
 <p>Time Shooter 2 is the thrilling sequel to the popular time-bending shooter game that has captivated players worldwide. This action-packed first-person shooter combines intense combat with innovative time manipulation mechanics, creating a unique gaming experience that stands out in the crowded shooter genre. Whether you're a fan of the original Time Shooter or new to the series, this guide will help you master Time Shooter 2's gameplay, features, and advanced strategies.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Play Time Shooter 2</h2>
        
        <p>Time Shooter 2 builds upon the foundation of its predecessor while introducing new mechanics that elevate the gameplay. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of how to play:</p>
        
        <h3>Basic Controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Movement:</strong> WASD keys for forward, backward, and strafing</li>
            <li><strong>Aim:</strong> Mouse movement to look around</li>
            <li><strong>Shoot:</strong> Left mouse button</li>
            <li><strong>Reload:</strong> R key</li>
            <li><strong>Time Slow:</strong> Right mouse button (hold to activate)</li>
            <li><strong>Time Stop:</strong> Q key (limited uses per level)</li>
            <li><strong>Weapon Switch:</strong> Mouse wheel or number keys</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
        <p>Time Shooter 2's core gameplay revolves around its innovative time manipulation system. Unlike traditional shooters where reflexes are everything, Time Shooter 2 allows you to:</p>

            <p><strong>Slow Time:</strong> Holding the right mouse button slows down time, giving you precious seconds to line up perfect shots or dodge incoming attacks. Your slow time ability is limited by an energy meter that recharges when not in use.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="feature-box">
            <p><strong>Stop Time:</strong> The Q key completely stops time for a few seconds, allowing you to reposition, reload, or set up devastating attacks. Time Stop uses are limited per level, so use them strategically.</p>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Mastering Time Management</h3>
            <p>The key to success in Time Shooter 2 is managing your time abilities effectively. Use slow time for general combat, saving time stop for emergencies or particularly tough enemies. Watch your energy meter and learn to fight without time manipulation to let it recharge.</p>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Movement is Key</h3>

        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Prioritize Targets</h3>
            <p>Some enemies are more dangerous than others. Focus on eliminating enemies with ranged weapons first, then deal with melee foes. Watch for special enemies that can disrupt your time abilities.</p>
